Here are some of my top projects — click through for full reports, code, and results.

### 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance (Capstone @ Sandia Labs)

[**Structural Fatigue Prediction with Vibration Signals**](https://github.com/dianeegret/2025-Structural-Fatigue-Aircraft-Engines)

* Built models to predict **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines using NASA C-MAPSS data.
* Tested Random Forests, GRUs, and **Attention-LSTMs** → best model improved interpretability & accuracy.
* Sponsor: **Sandia National Laboratories**, Albuquerque, NM.

### 🧪 Environmental Data Mapping

[**Tox-E-Mapper**](https://github.com/dianeegret/2025-Tox-E-Mapper)

* Processed **EPA TRI data** (3M+ records) and applied **PCA + KMeans clustering**.
* Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** for exploring pollution hotspots.
* Compared usability vs EPA EnviroMapper — users found **Tox-E-Mapper faster & easier**.

### 🌊 Conservation Analytics

[**Right Whale Spatial Distribution**](https://github.com/dianeegret/2022-Whale-Habitat-Distribution)

* Combined whale sighting data, shipping routes, and bathymetry.
* Built R maps showing overlap of whales and ship traffic — highlighting conservation risks.
* Demonstrates **geospatial data cleaning + layered visualization**.
* Internship completed at the **University of Miami**’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.
