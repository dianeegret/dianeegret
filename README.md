### 🗺️ Environmental Data Mapping

[**Tox-E-Mapper**](https://github.com/dianeegret/2025-Tox-E-Mapper)

* Processed **EPA TRI data** (3M+ records) and applied **PCA + KMeans clustering**.
* Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** for exploring pollution hotspots.
* Compared usability vs EPA EnviroMapper — users found **Tox-E-Mapper faster & easier**.
